# Title: Final Testing, Deployment, and Launch
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
# Priority: critical
# Description: Conduct comprehensive end-to-end testing, prepare the production environment, and deploy the application for its official launch.
# Details:
This final phase ensures the application is bug-free, performs well under load, and is correctly configured on the production server. The target implementation date is August 2025.
# Test Strategy:
Perform a full regression test. Simulate 50+ concurrent users to test system stability. Complete a successful test deployment to a staging environment before the final production launch.

# Subtasks:
## 1. End-to-End User Acceptance Testing (UAT) [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Have stakeholders and target users test the application to confirm it meets all business requirements.
### Details:
Prepare test scripts for each user role. Schedule UAT sessions with representatives from the university's administrative areas to walk through all workflows.

## 2. Performance and Load Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Test the application's performance under expected user load.
### Details:
Use a tool like k6 or JMeter to simulate at least 50 concurrent users accessing various parts of the system. Monitor server CPU, memory usage, and database query times to identify and fix bottlenecks.

## 3. Production Server Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Prepare the production Linux (Ubuntu) server with all required software.
### Details:
Install and configure Nginx, MySQL 8.0+, and PHP 8.2+. Set up a deployment user and configure SSH keys. Configure Nginx to serve the Laravel application, including setting up SSL/TLS.

## 4. Create Deployment Script and Go-Live [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.3
### Description: Automate the deployment process and perform the final launch.
### Details:
Use a tool like Deployer or write a simple shell script to automate the deployment process (git pull, composer install, npm install, run migrations, clear cache). Perform the final deployment during a scheduled maintenance window.
