# Task ID: 3
# Title: Base UI/UX Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the base user interface structure using Tailwind CSS, implement intuitive navigation, and create role-differentiated dashboards.
# Details:
Responsive interface with Tailwind CSS. Implement main layout, navigation menus, and basic dashboard views for different roles.

# Test Strategy:
Test responsiveness on different devices, navigation flow, and correct dashboard display based on user role

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up Project and Integrate Tailwind CSS [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize the project structure (if not already done) and configure Tailwind CSS for use throughout the application to enable rapid UI development with utility classes.
### Details:
Install Tailwind CSS and its peer dependencies via npm or yarn. Configure `tailwind.config.js` to include paths to template files. Include the Tailwind directives (`@tailwind base`, `@tailwind components`, `@tailwind utilities`) in the main CSS file. Ensure the build process correctly compiles the CSS.

## 2. Implement Base Application Layout [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Create the main structural layout of the application, including header, main content area, and potentially a footer or sidebar container, using Tailwind CSS for styling and ensuring responsiveness.
### Details:
Define the primary layout component or structure (e.g., using flexbox or grid). Use Tailwind's responsive utility classes (e.g., `md:flex`, `lg:grid`) to ensure the layout adapts to different screen sizes. Include placeholders for the header, navigation, and main content area.

## 3. Develop Core Navigation Menu [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2
### Description: Build the primary navigation component, integrating it into the base layout. This component should contain placeholder links relevant to the application's main sections and be styled using Tailwind CSS.
### Details:
Create a dedicated navigation component (e.g., `Navbar` or `Sidebar`). Add placeholder list items or links for key application routes (e.g., Dashboard, Settings, Profile). Style the navigation using Tailwind classes for appearance, spacing, and responsiveness. Integrate this component into the appropriate section of the base layout.

## 4. Create Base Dashboard View (Default Role) [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.3
### Description: Develop the initial structure and basic elements for the default user dashboard view. This will serve as a template and starting point for role-specific variations, styled with Tailwind CSS.
### Details:
Create a `Dashboard` component or page. Add a simple title (e.g., 'Welcome to your Dashboard'), a placeholder welcome message, and basic structural elements like cards or sections where future content will reside. Use Tailwind classes for layout, typography, and basic styling.

## 5. Implement Role-Based Dashboard Routing and Placeholders [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.4
### Description: Set up the application's routing logic to direct users to appropriate dashboard views based on their assigned role. Implement basic conditional rendering or create placeholder components to differentiate the dashboard content for at least two distinct roles (e.g., Admin, Standard User).
### Details:
Implement routing logic using the chosen framework's router (e.g., React Router, Vue Router). Define routes that can accept a role parameter or use nested routes. Within the dashboard component or via separate components, add logic to display different titles, messages, or placeholder sections based on the user's role data (simulated or actual). Create minimal placeholder components for different roles if using separate views.
