# Task ID: 10
# Title: System Optimization and Advanced Features
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement system-wide optimizations (performance, caching), advanced search, automated backups, and finalize user documentation.
# Details:
Performance optimization (caching, query optimization). Implement global advanced search. Set up automated backup strategy. Refine UX based on feedback. Write comprehensive user documentation.

# Test Strategy:
Test system performance under load. Verify advanced search accuracy. Test backup process. Conduct user acceptance testing for UX improvements. Review documentation accuracy and completeness

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Core Performance Optimizations [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Analyze system performance bottlenecks, optimize database queries, and implement caching mechanisms to improve response times and reduce load.
### Details:
Use profiling tools to identify slow queries. Add necessary database indexes. Implement application-level caching (e.g., Redis, Memcached) for frequently accessed data. Configure database query caching if applicable.

## 2. Implement Global Advanced Search Feature [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Develop and integrate a system-wide advanced search capability allowing users to search across different data types and apply filters.
### Details:
Choose and set up a search engine (e.g., Elasticsearch, database full-text search). Define indexing strategy for relevant data models. Build search API endpoints. Integrate search interface into the application UI.

## 3. Set Up Automated Backup Strategy [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Establish a robust automated system for backing up application data (database, files) to ensure data recovery in case of failure.
### Details:
Define backup scope (database, user uploads, configuration). Choose backup destination (cloud storage, separate server). Select backup tools/scripts. Schedule automated backups (e.g., daily full, hourly incremental). Implement monitoring for backup success/failure. Document recovery procedures.

## 4. Refine User Experience Based on Feedback [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.3
### Description: Analyze collected user feedback and usability test results to identify and implement improvements to the application's user interface and workflows.
### Details:
Review feedback tickets/reports and prioritize UX issues. Implement changes to UI layouts, navigation, forms, error messages, etc., based on feedback. Conduct internal usability review.

## 5. Finalize Comprehensive User Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.4
### Description: Create or update user documentation to accurately reflect the current state of the system, including new features (advanced search), performance aspects, and usage guidelines.
### Details:
Structure documentation (e.g., using Sphinx, MkDocs, or a wiki). Write clear and concise content covering all features, setup, troubleshooting, and best practices. Include sections on advanced search usage and any relevant performance tips for users. Review and publish documentation.
