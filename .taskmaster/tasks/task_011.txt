# Task ID: 11
# Title: Security Hardening and Final Review
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 5, 6
# Priority: critical
# Description: Conduct a thorough security review and implement hardening measures to protect the application from common vulnerabilities.
# Details:
This involves enforcing security best practices across the entire application, including input validation, protection against common attacks, and secure configuration.
# Test Strategy:
Perform vulnerability scanning using automated tools. Conduct manual penetration testing for common vulnerabilities like SQL Injection, XSS, and CSRF. Review all access control logic.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Review and Enforce Input Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Audit all forms and API endpoints to ensure strict server-side validation is in place.
### Details:
Go through every `FormRequest` or inline validation rule in the application. Ensure that all user-submitted data is validated for type, size, format, and existence in other tables where applicable.

## 2. Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up a Content Security Policy to mitigate XSS and other injection attacks.
### Details:
Use a package like `spatie/laravel-csp` to configure and enable a strict CSP. The policy should only allow scripts and styles from trusted sources.

## 3. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection Review [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure all state-changing routes (POST, PUT, DELETE) are protected by CSRF tokens.
### Details:
Laravel provides this by default for web routes. This subtask involves auditing all forms to ensure the `@csrf` directive is present and verifying that non-web routes (if any) have alternative protection like Sanctum tokens.

## 4. Review Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Perform a full audit of all middleware and in-controller permission checks.
### Details:
Create a matrix of roles vs. routes/actions. Manually test each one to ensure that users can only access the resources and perform the actions permitted for their role, as defined in the documentation.
