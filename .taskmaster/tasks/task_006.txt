# Task ID: 6
# Title: Generic Content Components (News & Contact Forms)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop reusable components for managing news/events and handling contact form submissions, as these are common features across multiple modules.
# Details:
Using Livewire, create a "News" component for CRUD operations, handling image uploads with validation (JPG, PNG, WebP; max 5MB). Create a reusable "Contact Form" component that sends an email to the corresponding area's institutional address.
# Test Strategy:
Verify that news can be created/updated/deleted. Test the public news feed order (descending chronological). Test that each contact form routes emails to the correct recipient.
