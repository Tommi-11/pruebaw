# Task ID: 2
# Title: Authentication and User Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement secure user authentication with differentiated roles (Super Admin, Admin, etc.) and basic user management functionalities.
# Details:
Laravel Auth with middleware for roles, password recovery, access auditing. Implement user CRUD for administrators.

# Test Strategy:
Test user registration, login/logout for all roles, password reset, and role-based access control

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Basic Laravel Authentication Flow [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the core user authentication features including registration, login, and logout using Laravel's built-in authentication scaffolding or manual implementation.
### Details:
Use `laravel/ui` or `laravel/breeze` or `laravel/jetstream` to quickly scaffold the basic auth routes, controllers, and views/APIs. Configure the User model and database migrations if starting manually. Ensure basic login, registration, and logout functionality works correctly.

## 2. Integrate User Roles and Middleware [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Add support for user roles (e.g., Super Admin, Admin, Standard User) and implement middleware to restrict access to routes based on these roles.
### Details:
Add a `role` column (or a separate roles table with relationships) to the `users` table. Define role constants or an enum. Create or modify middleware (e.g., `App\Http\Middleware\CheckRole.php`) to check the authenticated user's role against required roles for specific routes or controller methods. Apply this middleware to relevant routes.

## 3. Implement Password Reset Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Configure and implement the password reset flow, allowing users to request a password reset link via email and set a new password.
### Details:
Utilize Laravel's built-in password reset features. Configure mail settings in `.env`. Run necessary migrations (`php artisan migrate`). Implement the routes and controllers for requesting a reset link, sending the email, and handling the password update form. Ensure token validation and expiration are handled.

## 4. Develop User Management (CRUD) Interface for Admins [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Create the necessary components (routes, controllers, views/APIs) for administrators to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on user accounts.
### Details:
Create a `UserController` (or similar) to handle user management logic. Define routes for listing, viewing, creating, editing, and deleting users. Implement the corresponding methods in the controller. Ensure these routes are protected by the role middleware (e.g., only accessible by 'Admin' or 'Super Admin'). Implement validation for user creation/update forms.

## 5. Implement Basic Access and User Action Auditing [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.4
### Description: Set up logging to record key authentication events (login, logout, login failures) and user management actions performed by administrators.
### Details:
Use Laravel's built-in logging or a dedicated package (e.g., `spatie/laravel-activitylog`). Log events like successful login, failed login attempts (including IP), logout, user creation, user update, and user deletion. Store relevant information like user ID, action type, timestamp, and potentially IP address or changed data.
